# Settings (as I think of them)

## Decoder
- Warn about discouraged (TABLE_OUT_OF_ORDER, BLANK_KEY, KEY_OUT_OF_ORDER, INLINE_MULTI_LINES)
- Language version support (V1_0_0, V1_1_0)
## Encoder
- Encode unicode characters as \u literals

## Notes
For inline tables, in v1.0.0, splitting across multiple lines is illegal. In v1.1.0 it is simply discouraged.
